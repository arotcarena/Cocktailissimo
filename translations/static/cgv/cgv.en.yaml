The information collected in these two questionnaires is subject to automated data processing for which Avis Vérifiés is responsible.</p>
  <p>Avis Vérifiés will use the buyer's personal data solely for the purpose of its solution and for its needs only. The buyer's personal data is hosted by Amazon AWS.
